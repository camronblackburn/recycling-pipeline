# The Great Problem of Waste Management

*Final project submitted by Robert Mahari and Camron Blackburn for [MAS.S67 The Great Problems](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/7934) MIT Media Lab course taught by Kevin Esvelt. Site source code [here](https://github.com/camronblackburn/recycling-pipeline).*

## [Characterizing the (Great) Problem]({{ '/problem.html' | relative_url }})
Nearly every person, household, organization, or company generates waste. This can come in various forms: municipal solid waste (aka trash), compost, recycling, hazardous waste, electronic waste, medical waste, construction and demolition debris, agricultural and animal waste, oil and gas production waste, or sewage sludge. What is the collective impact of this waste on the environment and climate and human health? This page explores tries to answer this question through both quantitative and qualitative means.

## [Existing Solution Efforts]({{ '/existing_solution.html' | relative_url }})
What types of programs and/or technology is in existence today that could solve the problems?

## [Proposed Solutions]({{ '/compost_example.html' | relative_url }})
Proposed solution to waste gas emissions - specifically a back of the envelope calculation of the impact of compost 100% of organic waste.

## [Recycling "Solution"]({{ '/recycle_drivers.html' | relative_url }})
How does recycling work to mitigate negative environmental impacts of waste management? Is it as effective as it markets to be? Or is it just theater to make consumers feel less guilty about single-use products?

## [Case Study: Local Recycling]({{ '/data.html' | relative_url }})
A local look on recycling data and it's place in the waste pipeline.
